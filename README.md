**"Solara Shakir"** is an educational sci-fi adventure game combining
**environmental awareness**, **space exploration**, and **interactive
solar restoration mechanics**. Players take the role of **Shah Sikandar
Ahmad Shakir**, an environmentalist who revives dying ecosystems on
Earth and alien planets using **pure sunlight energy**.

The game blends **cinematic storytelling**, **real-world NASA solar
science**, and **planetary ecology** into engaging, interactive gameplay
designed to inspire climate action and global cooperation.

**Core Themes:**

-   Sunspot Mapping & Space Science

-   Solar Energy & Photosynthesis

-   Planetary Environmental Restoration

**NASA Connection:**

Real sunspot data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is used
to drive in-game sunspot mapping and energy absorption mechanics,
linking gameplay directly to authentic solar science. The game also
partially uses and modifies real datasets from NASA's Aura, Aqua, MODIS,
SDO, PACE satellites, and imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope.

**Sustainability Link:** Demonstrates scientifically inspired methods of
ecosystem revival and sustainable planetary management.

-   SDG 13 --- Climate Action

-   SDG 14 --- Life Below Water

-   SDG 15 --- Life on Land

**Target Audience**

-   **Age Range:** 10+ years

-   **Educational Use:** Ideal for STEM programs, environmental science
    courses, and gamified learning initiatives.

-   **Global Appeal:** Designed for worldwide audiences passionate about
    climate action, sustainability, and space exploration.

**Gameplay Flow & Full Project Summary**

**Gameplay Journey & Levels**

**Level 1: Earth - Prologue**

-   Shah discovers the Sunspot Scanner.

-   Player learns **sunspot mapping** and **energy absorption**.

-   First restoration: Revives a dying tree via photosynthesis.

**Level 2: Earth - Restoration**

-   Restores a toxic river and aquatic plants.

-   Movement grows globally.

-   **Plot Twist:** "Your mission is not limited to the Earth\... the
    universe awaits your restoration."

**Level 3: Verdara Saga**

-   Travels to **Verdara** (forest planet with severe time dilation ---
    1 day here = 1 hour on Earth).

-   Urgent timed restoration challenges.

-   Local allies stabilize the planet by planting more trees.

**Level 4: Nurea's Awakening**

-   Arrives at **Nurea Prime** (water world with poisoned oceans).

-   Uses refracted sunlight to revive plankton and coral cities.

-   Marine ecosystems flourish again.

**Level 5: Final Battle**

-   **Darknova** rises in the seas of **APM 08279+5255**.

-   Player unites Earth, Verdara, and Nurea forces.

-   Constructs the Solar Cannon and destroys Darknova with a massive
    solar blast.

**Full Project Summary**

> Team **ULKA** presents **Solara Shakir** --- A Game of Light and Hope,
> inspired by Shah Sikandar Ahmad Shakir, the "Tree Man of Sylhet," who
> planted over 30,000 trees in ten years. Using real NASA datasets
> (Aura, Aqua, MODIS, SDO, PACE, Hubble), the game raises awareness of
> deforestation, pollution, and global warming through interactive
> storytelling. In this game, players begin on Earth, where Shah
> discovers the Sunspot Scanner, learns sunspot mapping, and restores a
> dying tree. He then revives polluted rivers and aquatic life, sparking
> a global movement before realizing his mission extends beyond Earth.
> On Verdara, a forest planet with extreme time dilation, players face
> urgent restoration challenges with local allies. On Nurea Prime, a
> poisoned ocean world, refracted sunlight restores plankton and coral
> cities, reviving marine ecosystems. Finally, in APM 08279+5255,
> Darknova emerges, and with united forces from Earth, Verdara, and
> Nurea, Shah builds the Solar Cannon and defeats the darkness with a
> massive solar blast. Designed for ages 10+, the game blends space
> science, sustainability, and gamified STEM learning to inspire climate
> action and global cooperation.

**"Solara Shakir"** is a cinematic, science-inspired adventure that
merges **space science**, **environmental restoration**, and
**interactive learning**. By combining AI-powered creative design,
NASA's authentic solar data, and advanced video production tools, **Team
ULKA** delivers a game experience aimed at educating and inspiring the
next generation of climate-conscious explorers.
